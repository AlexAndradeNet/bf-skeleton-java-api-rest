# REST ASSURED API TESTING FOR THE STAR WARS DATABASE

This robot uses **JSON Schema validations** of Star Wars API database (Swapi) responses. This helps
detect any changes and assess their impact on other projects.

This project leverages the **Serenity BDD** framework, a comprehensive library designed to streamline the creation of
high-quality automated acceptance tests, significantly reducing development time. Promoting adherence to the SOLID
principles ensures that the source code remains maintainable and robust. Additionally, Serenity BDD offers 
extensive reporting tools and supports parallel test execution, enhancing efficiency and productivity.

Source code serves as a vital communication medium among developers, making it crucial to maintain its cleanliness
and readability. This project incorporates linting tools such as **pre-commit** to ensure code quality, which
automatically formats the code with each execution. The project's repository is hosted on GitHub and utilizes **GitHub
Actions** for continuous integration, effectively preventing the merge of any code that falls short of established
quality standards.

Finally, the project integrates **SonarQube** to analyze the source code and identify potential issues, ensuring the 
codebase remains clean and maintainable. You can see more about this in the [CONTRIBUTE.md](CONTRIBUTE.md) section _"Static Code 
Analysis"_.

## üöÄ EXECUTION

### Run all tests

```bash
mvn clean verify
```

### Run a specific test

You have two options. You can do it through the command line:

```bash
mvn clean verify -Dcucumber.options="--tags @tag"
```

You can do it through the IDE by opening the feature file and clicking on the play
button.

### Open the test report

After the execution with the command line, you can open the report in the
following
path [target/site/serenity/index.html](target/site/serenity/index.html).
